# wp-advanced-logs
A really simple Wordpress plugin to improve WP logging capabilities for developpers, based upon the [log4php](https://logging.apache.org/log4php/index.html) framework. 

Wordpress default log system (wp-content/debug.log) isn't very powerful. If you have to trace events with accuracy, this plugin tries to help developpers by adding useful PHP methods to add important informations in a log file

## Features

* Add and instantiate a Logger Class you can access everywhere in your Code (Theme, plugin)
* Provide several methods to trace your data in log files
* Support various built-in log message formats, including XML, HTML or user-defined pattern

## Installation

The plugin can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is".
